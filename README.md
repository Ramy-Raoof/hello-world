# hello-world
A simple starting project that was triggered by a need to get to classes quicker at school. So what this is is an app. that will help me and other students get to classes faster. It is a navigation system that is designed only for Fullerton college. It will lead a person from their current position on campus to the desired classroom location just by typing the classroom number into the app..
